## States of India Game in Python
This is an interactive game where map of India will be displayed and the user would be guessing all the States & Union Territories of India. 
On correct guessing, the input will be  placed in its corresponding location on map. If the user quits the game before guessing all the states and Union Territories,
then the States and Union territories for which user failed to guess will be automatically placed in their corresponding location in different colour indicating those were 
not guessed by the user. This game is particularly useful for the kids in remembering all the States and Union Territories of India in the most effective way.
